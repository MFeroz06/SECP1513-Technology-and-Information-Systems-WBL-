## ✨ Reflection
---
> The PPG talk made me realise how important ICT jobs really are in keeping an industry tunning smoothly. I learned that ICT people are the ones who plan,build, and maintain systems so that everything works properly. It made me see that a career in ICT is not just about technology, but about making a real, meaningful contribution to an organisation.
