## ✨ Reflection
---
> After hearing the talk, I plan to learn many programming languages, as different jobs require different types of programming skills. Mastering various programming languages is good preparation for facing challenges in the industry. I will also improve my writing, communication, and technical skills. While technical skills are important, teamwork is equally important. Without teamwork, our work will not improve, and it is difficult to develop ourselves if we do not rely on our team members. Other than that, I also understand the concept of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which will be a great preparation for an upcoming project and industry.

## ✅ Conclusion
---
> Agile is the most recommended Project Management methodology, as it allows for changes at any time, where as Waterfall requires a single, fixed goal. It is really important to fully understand Project Management and System Development to get accepted in any company. The session was very insightful and full of engagement as the speaker knows how to get the students involved in the discussion to keep the whole session interesting and interactive
