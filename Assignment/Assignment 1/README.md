## ✨ Reflection
---
>   The visit to UTMDigital has provided great benefits to the students as it was filled with many meanigful activities such as educational talks, real-world practices, and networking opportunities to help them gain valuable insights beyond classroom learning.
> 
>   These activities has made a positive impact on the course as students can develop a clearer understanding towards their area of study while reinforcing what they have learned in class. It may also increased their curiosity and motivation to explore the course further. From the activity, I learn something impactful. I realized that data engineers play a very important role in cleaning raw daata and managing data pipelines. They also ensure data quality for analysts and data scientists to use.
>
>  The activities spark excitement and interest in many ways. For example, I was interested when I heard that the salary for fresh graduates is quite high, and that it can doube or even triple as you become a junior or senior. I also learned that data engineers have many job opportunities in different industries.
>
>  I feel that visiting the organisation and attending talk helps me learn the course material better, it helped us connect what we learned in lectures to real-world applications, and it also gave us a clearer understanding of our course objectives and what we are working towards in our field of study.
