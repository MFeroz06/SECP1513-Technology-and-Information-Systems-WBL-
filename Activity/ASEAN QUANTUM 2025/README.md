## ✨ Reflection
> I don't take physics, but I try my best to understand about quantum. Quantum Physics does sound close to digital logic during the talk for our semester this year. The speaker mentions about odd parity and even parity. They also mention about Logic Circuit for quantum. And also about the computer with quantum. I truly appreciate the chance that have given to us from lecturers. I thought that quantum which is physics only allow physics student to join, but I never expected that non-physics student can also join the program.


## ✨ Suggestion for Improvement
> To add a lot of interesting booth and some booth that are academic and also have fun activity so participants can learn and also have fun.
