## ✨ Reflection
---
> It's been a fun experience since I gain knowledge from the lab activity, which is PC Assembly, I also gain friends at that moments. We were having fun assembling the PC and at the same time we are too nervous for the test . The lab assistant also helped us and explain to us the step of assembling the PC.

## Suggestion for Improvement
---
> Provide a bigger space for students to assembly the PC, since it is really cramped inside a small room with 33 people excluding lab assistant. Also provide many PC so that each students can experience assemblying the PC.

## Steps to Assembly the PC
1. Install CPU on the Motherboard
2. Install RAM
3. Install Power Supply
4. Install Graphic Card (GPU)
5. Insert Hard Disk
6. Connect Wire
